##Problem 1 : Search in a Rotated Sorted Array

This problem requires to find given number in an array. So th Binary search algorithm fits for this problem to find 
given number from the array as the array is sorted but for this problem, I need to search for number in rotated array. 
So in order to achieve the required solution I need to find pivot point from where the array is rotated and after that 
I can implement Binary Search and that is what I have done for this problem. 

`Time Complexity for this problem is O(log(n)) and Space Complexity for this problem is O(1)`
