##Problem 3 : Rearrange Array Elements

This problems requires to maximize the sum of two numbers formed from array. In order to solve this problem, I am 
iterating through the list and getting frequency of numbers from array and storing it in a new array. Using these 
frequencies, I am creating two numbers from array and joining to create the list.

`Time coomplexity of this problem is O(log n) and space complexity of this problem is O(1)`
