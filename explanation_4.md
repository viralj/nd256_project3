##Problem 4 : Dutch National Flag Problem

This problem requires to sort an array that consist 0, 1 and 2 only. In order to complete this problem and solve it in 
liner time, I am first calculating the frequency of occurrences of numbers 0, 1 and 2 and creating new sorted list 
using frequencies.

`Time Complexity of this problem is O(n) and Space Complexity of this problem is O(n)`
