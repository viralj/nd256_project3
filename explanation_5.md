##Problem 5 : Autocomplete with Tries

In this problem I have implemented Trie structure that is similar to Tree structure to store dynamic set of strings.
Using class TrieNode and its methods `insert` and `suffixes` I am using Trie class to solve the problem.


    TrieNode's time complexity and space complexity to insert a character is O(1).
    TrieNode's time complexity and space complexity of suffixes of a node is O(M*N).

    Trie's time complexity and space complexity to insert a word is O(n).
    Trie's time complexity to find a prefix is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).
